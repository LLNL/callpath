# - callpath: (Todd's TO DO)
#
#=============================================================================
# callpath is ....  (Todd's TO DO)
#
#=== Usage ===================================================================
# This file allows Adept Utils to be automatically detected by other libraries
# using CMake.  To build with callpath, you can do one of two things:
#
#   1. Set the callpath_DIR environment variable to the root of the Adept Utils
#      installation.  If you loaded callpath through a dotkit, this may already
#      be set, and callpath will be autodetected by CMake.
#
#   2. Configure your proeject with this option:
#      -D callpath_DIR=/path/to/dir/containing/this/file
#
# If you have done either of these things, then CMake should automatically find
# and include this file when you call find_package(callpath) from your
# CMakeLists.txt file.
#
#=== Components ==============================================================
# (Todd's TO DO)
#
# To link against these, just do, for example:
#
#   find_package(callpath REQUIRED)
#   add_executable(foo foo.c)
#   target_link_libraries(foo callpath-component)
#
# That's all!
